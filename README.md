Credit Scoring Business Understanding
Basel II Accord and Model Interpretability:
Basel II emphasizes quantitative risk measurement and regulatory compliance. Models must be interpretable and well-documented so that credit decisions can be explained and justified to regulators.
Need for a Proxy Variable:
Since the dataset lacks a direct default label, a proxy variable based on transaction behavior or RFM features allows indirect estimation of risk. Business risk exists because imperfect proxies may lead to incorrect predictions, either denying credit to good customers or granting credit to risky ones.
Trade-offs Between Simple and Complex Models:
Simple, interpretable models like Logistic Regression are easy to explain, align with Basel II requirements, and provide clear feature importance, but may miss complex patterns and have slightly lower predictive accuracy. 
Complex, high-performance models like Gradient Boosting can capture nonlinear relationships and often achieve higher accuracy, but they are harder to interpret and can create regulatory compliance risk.
Takeaway
In regulated financial contexts, explainability and transparency are often more important than maximizing predictive performance.
